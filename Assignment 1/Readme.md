##  Task 1 – Basic Arithmetic Operations

**Description:**  
This program performs basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division — between two numbers entered by the user.

**Code Summary:**
- Takes two integer inputs (`n1` and `n2`)
- Calculates:
  - Addition → `A = n1 + n2`
  - Subtraction → `S = n1 - n2`
  - Multiplication → `M = n1 * n2`
  - Division → `D = n1 / n2`
- Displays all results clearly using formatted print statements

**Example Output:**
Enter the first number = 10
Enter the Second number = 5
Addition = 15
Subtraction = 5
Multiplication = 50
Division = 2.0

## Task 2 – Full Name Generator

**Description:**  
This program takes the user's first and last name as input and combines them into a full name.

**Code Summary:**
- Takes two string inputs: `fn` (First Name) and `ln` (Last Name)
- Combines them into one string → `full_name = fn + " " + ln`
- Prints a greeting message using the full name

**Example Output:**
Enter Your First name: John
Enter Your Last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
